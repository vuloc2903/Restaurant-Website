Our Vu Dinh Loc Restaurant website project is built with a strong emphasis on functionality and user interactivity. Behind the scenes, we employ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a seamless user experience. The JavaScript code is instrumental in form validation on the 'Restaurant Booking' page, ensuring that users provide accurate information when making reservations. It also facilitates the real-time confirmation of reservations through the 'Booking Details' section, enhancing user confidence.

Moreover, we've implemented JavaScript for dynamic effects, such as the 'Submit Booking' button's confirmation and the visual indication of successful submissions through the 'Success Message.' These elements enhance the user experience by providing immediate feedback.

To promote responsive design, CSS is utilized to style the website for optimal viewing on various devices, adjusting the layout and visuals accordingly. Additionally, the 'Contact Us' page includes links to our social media profiles, making it easy for users to connect with us.

In terms of future improvements, our project could be extended to include additional features such as online payment processing, feedback forms, and customer account management, further enhancing the website's functionality and user engagement
